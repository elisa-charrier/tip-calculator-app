## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Responsive design
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Javascript 
- HTML DOM API

### What I learned

This was my first challenge using Javascript in a website. I improved my knoledge about Document interface and Javascript event listeners.
Also, I tried to keep an eye on acessibility.  

### Continued development

My next step will be trying to better organise CSS in order to easly modify and reuse colors, typography, spacing and other variables. Stay tuned to see the next project!
